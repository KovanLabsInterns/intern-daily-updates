# Intern Daily Update Workflow

Welcome to the Kovan Interns Daily Update repository. This creates a transparent log of our work and helps us identify blockers early.

## The Workflow

### 1. Morning: Create Your Plan
1. Go to the **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Select **Daily Update**.
4. Set the title: `YYYY-MM-DD: Daily Update - Your Name`
   - Example: `2024-01-22: Daily Update - Akshay`
5. List your tasks for the day in the checklist.
6. Submit the issue.

### 2. During the Day: Communicate
- If you face a blocker, comment on the issue and tag your mentor.
- Example: "@mentor I'm stuck on the database connection."

### 3. End of Day: Wrap Up
1. Go back to your issue.
2. Check off `[x]` the tasks you completed.
3. Add a comment if you have unfinished items moving to tomorrow.
4. **Close the issue**.

## Labels
- **Domain**: Apply the label relevant to your stack (e.g., `Domain: Python`, `Domain: Java`).
